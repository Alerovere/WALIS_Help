##Material and biological facies data
**Terrace ID** - Identified terrace the sample came from.</br>
**Facies description** - Sedimentary facies context and outcrop information on coral or mollusk sample.</br>
**Reported as in situ?** - If the samples was explicitly stated as being in situ in the original publication. Note: for drill cores it must be assumed that samples are not in situ unless explicitly stated, or if referred to as "coral framework" or equivalent. If the sample is considered to be in "growth position", then it must be also assumed to be in situ.</br>
**Reported as in growth position?** - If the sample was explicitly stated as being in growth position in the original publication.</br>
**Taxa information (as reported)** - Taxonomic identification of sample as reported in original manuscript.*Corals only*</br>
**Family**	- Insert the family the sample belongs to.</br>
**Genus** - Insert the genis the sample belongs to.</br>
**Species**	- Insert the species the sample belongs to.</br>
**Comments on Species**	- Insert comments on the species/genus/family above.</br>
**Original palaeodepth interpretation** - The environmental or palaeo water-depth interpretation from the original publication (or references therein).</br>

*The following fields appear only if 'Speleothem' is selected as 'Material type'*</br>
**Type of deposit** - Type of speleothem deposit (e.g. flowstone, stalactite, stalagmite, etc.).</br>
**Distance from base of deposit (m)** - How far along the growth axis the sample is from the base of the speleothem. If the speleothem base is at a lower elevation then the samples, use positive distance. If the speleothem base is higher in elevation, make it negative. If the deposit is at the same elevation as the base, report as positive and make a note in the "Comments (elevation)" column.	
**Sampled material** - The type of material sampled (e.g. speleothem, serpulid worm tube, phreatic overgrowth on speleothem).</br>
**Reported in situ?** - Is the speleothem in original growth orientation? Note: Samples that are not in their original growth orientation (e.g. "in situ rubble") are NOT considered in situ here.</br>
**Additional sample context** - Any other information that can place the sample in context to the rest of the deposit (e.g. if the sample is directly above/below a depositional hiatus).</br>

##Analytical details
**Pa/Th age?** - Is there is a Pa/Th age for the sample?</br>
**14C age?** - Is there a <sup>14</sup>C age for the sample?</br>
**Instrument** - Type of mass spectrometer used for U-series isotopic Analysis: typically TIMS or MC-ICP-MS.</br>
**Decay constants** - Select the decay constants used as follows:</br>
- D1 = <sup>234</sup>U decay constant from Holden (1989) and 230Th decay constants of Meadows et al (1980)</br>
- D2 = <sup>234</sup>U and <sup>230</sup>Th decay constants from Cheng et al. (2000)</br>
- D3 = <sup>234</sup>U and <sup>230</sup>Th decay constants from Cheng et al. (2013)</br>
- No Info, therefore assumed D1</br>
**Comments on decay constants** - Insert here any comment related to the field above.</br>
**Calibration method for <sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>238</sup>U ratio** - Indicate how the <sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>238</sup>U ratios of the spike were calibrated: either a secular equilibrium (SE) or gravimetric (G) standard</br>
**Calibration method for <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U ratio** - Indicate how the <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U ratios of the spike were calibrated: either a secular equilibrium (SE) or gravimetric (G) standard</br>
**Comments on spike calibration** - Insert here comments on the fields above.<br>
**Published % calcite** *(Only for corals and mollusks)* - Reported % calcite content of the sample determined via X-ray diffraction (XRD).</br>
**Interpreted % calcite** *(Only for corals and mollusks)* - Interpretation of calcite content based on what was reported for '% calcite'.</br>
**Other screening techniques applied** - Other approaches besides XRD that were used to assess sample preservation (incorporates older information from "determined by" column in Hibbert et al., 2016)[^1]</br>
