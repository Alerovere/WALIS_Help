# WALIS Help
This page contains help tips to compile data into the World Atlas of Last Interglacial Shorelines database. </br></br>

Many of the data insertion tabs start asking wether the data can be made publicly visible. If data are made public, everyone logging into WALIS will be able to see them, but not edit them. Once made public, data can be edited by the original user, but not deleted. To delete a data point, please email arovere@marum.de.</br></br>

The data inserted in some selected section is by default made public. This means that, once a record is saved, it can be seen and used by any WALIS user.</br>

Please report any bugs or suggestions for improvement of the WALIS database to arovere@marum.de</br>
