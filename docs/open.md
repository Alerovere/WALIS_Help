**Open data**

WALIS is work in progress, as part of a Journal Special Issue in Earth System Science Data. The data is made available to the public in real time as soon as "Public" is selected in the insert data option. 

There are two main ways to visualize the data:

1. Explore both public and un-published (limited information only) data in a webmap. 
2. Explore and download the data through the "Publicly available data" tab in the main menu.
