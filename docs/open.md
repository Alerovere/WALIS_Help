**Open data**

WALIS is work in progress, as part of a Special Issue in the Journal "Earth System Science Data", an open-access publication by Copernicus. A series of invited authors is working on data insertion, and will compile regional papers within the Special Issue.

If you are not involved in the Special Issue, you can still insert data and they will remain private. If you want to make them public, or contribute to the Special Issue, we kindly invite you to contact arovere@marum.de

All data will be made public upon completion of the Special Issue, which is expected to be completed towards the end of 2020.

If you notice discrepancies of errors within the database, please write a bug report.
